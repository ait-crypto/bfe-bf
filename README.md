Bloom Filter Encryption from Boneh-Franklin IBE
===============================================

This library implements bloom filter encryption (BFE) based on the paper [*Bloom Filter Encryption
and Applications to Efficient Forward-Secret 0-RTT Key Exchange*](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/199)
by David Derler, Tibor Jager, Daniel Slamanig, and Christoph Striecks. It implements IND-CCA2-secure
BFE based on the Boneh-Franklin IBE.

Dependencies
------------

The BFE library requires the following dependencies:
* [relic](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic)
* [libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/)
* [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) (optional, for documentation)
* [cgreen](https://github.com/cgreen-devs/cgreen) (optional, for tests)

Building
--------

First configure the build with `cmake` and then run `make`:
