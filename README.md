Bloom Filter Encryption library
===============================

This library implements bloom filter encryption (BFE) based on the paper [*Bloom Filter Encryption
and Applications to Efficient Forward-Secret 0-RTT Key Exchange*](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/199)
by David Derler, Tibor Jager, Daniel Slamanig, and Christoph Striecks. It implements IND-CCA2-secure
BFE based on the Boneh-Franklin IBE.
